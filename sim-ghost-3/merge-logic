If a clortho hears a foreign clortho ping it responds with a clortho
greeting.

If a clortho gets a clortho greeting it starts a timeout for that
clortho. (20 s)

The clortho checks if its venkmann number is bigger than the one in
the greeting.  If yes send greeting and do nothing.

If no check if the sum is bigger than the maximum size send a merge
request M-Message.  If yes do nothing.

If a clortho gets a merge request (M) it returns an accept N.

If a clortho gets a N message it sends a egonize (E) timeout 5 seconds
demotes himself to egon sending venkmann_request immediately.
