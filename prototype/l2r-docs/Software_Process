Documentation System
A project has the following documentation:

Research Notebook - This is normally notes kept during the research phase of
the project life. It usually consists of a RFC, a FAQ and a reference 
implementation, as well as notes kept by the researcher. A research notebook
is not guarenteed to exist, be complete, or have any useful information.

Marketing Concept - This is a brief summary of the opportunity as it arose
that the project was initiated for. It summarizes the potential customer,
the research applicable, and the target market.

the project, and the project leader.
