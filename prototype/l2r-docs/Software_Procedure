Software Procedure


1) Conceptual Phase

- research is done at this stage. There is no formal procedure of any
work completed in this stage.
- all work done at this stage is stored electronically in a CVS repository
for evaluation by the next phase.
- internal RFC's are passed around and filled out for new products and
processes.

2) Evaluation Phase

- all work in the research phase is evaluated periodically (at least once
a month) by a group of people including marketing and sales.
- the group evaluates the research based on exsiting sales opportunities and
future consideration.
- a project is initiated based on existing research, a project manager is
assigned and a team is built.


3) Product Development Phase

- architecture. The architecture of the product is defined and possibly
integrated with the existing system. The architect signs off on all
architecture documents and sends them to the specification team.

- detailed specification of the product is produced. The specification team 
signs off on the specification and is sent to the development testing, and
QA team.

- development of the test plan is defined and is sent to the development
team for sign off.

- development team writes code and documentation for the product.

- build team creates the automatic build system for the product, integration
for the product with the rest of the system.

- unit test team builds automatic testing system, with test case development.
- unit testing occurs as quickly as a complete build succeeds.

- product builds are completed on scheduled intervals signed off by all
developers and test team and delivered to the Q/A department.

4) QA Phase

- QA test plans are written and signed off.

- On each product build, the signed off build is tested. If the product
passes it is placed into the repository.
